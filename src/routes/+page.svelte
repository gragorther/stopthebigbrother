<PageTitle title="Stop the Big Brother" />
<p>
	Do you know who is watching? Who is invading your privacy? Who sees what you do on the road and at
	home, at work and in the bathroom? Digital eyes are all around us, and privacy is slowly
	disappearing.
</p>
<p>
	To avoid falling into a dystopia, we stand up for the protection of privacy and the right to
	invisibility. Say no to Big Brother!
